- this is a react-router v7 (remix) app.
- using typescript.
- indent with tabs, not spaces.
- do not change code that doesn't relate to the requested change.
- refactor when functions get too long.
- create new react components for reusable elements.
- move reusable functions that do not depend on React to a seperate file.
- remove code that becomes abosolete or unused due to changes being made.
- prefer plain for-loops over array.foreach and array.reduce
- only add comments when the code is not obvious, or the reason for the approach is not obvious.
