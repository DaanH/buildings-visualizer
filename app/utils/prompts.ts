	"Using the provided image, generate a grayscale segmentation mask that highlights only the visible painted or wallpapered interior walls. Wall areas should be in white (255), with smooth gradients and anti-aliasing at edges for realistic blending. All other elements — including furniture, people, pets, floors, ceilings, windows, curtains, doors, moldings, artwork, mirrors, lights, and any non-wall surfaces — should be completely black (0). Where semi-transparent or translucent objects (like sheer curtains or glass) overlap the wall, represent them with appropriate grayscale values to reflect partial visibility. This mask will be used to replace wall paint or wallpaper, so precise and accurate delineation of wall surfaces is essential.";
