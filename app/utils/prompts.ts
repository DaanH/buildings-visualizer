Wall areas should be in white (255), with anti-aliasing at edges for realistic blending. All other elements — including furniture, people, pets, floors, ceilings, windows, curtains, doors, moldings, artwork, mirrors, lights, and any non-wall surfaces — should be completely black (0). This mask will be used to replace wall paint or wallpaper, so precise and accurate delineation of wall surfaces is essential.";
